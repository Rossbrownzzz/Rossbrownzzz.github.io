				<p>
					I had the opportunity to work as a software development engineer intern at John Deere in the summer of 2022. I worked on two 
					projects, one in machine learning and the other in cyber-security.
				</p>
				<p>
					My primary project was developing a program to help categorize support tickets to ensure they were going to the correct 
					support group. This was particularly pressing as support was becoming a monster consuming roughly 30% sprint velocity for 
					my team. To help achieve this, I employed natural language processing and neural networks. I used a simple feedforward 
					neural network with a categorical cross entropy loss function training on tokenized versions of the tickets. A simple GUI 
					using TKinter allowed the user to request classification of new tickets.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another task related to the support tickets was finding similar tickets to the ones the user was inputting to help quantify 
					the support impact of different applications rather than relying on tribal knowledge to diagnose weak points. This would 
					also allow the user to see the most similar tickets to the one they provided which enables them to determine if there is 
					already a solution to a similar issue which can be used to guide the process. To do this I represented tickets using term 
					frequency inverse document frequency transformations before calculating cosine similarities.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second project that I took on was resolving some of the cyber-security vulnerabilities facing the team. Across the 
					teams 6 web applications developed over 10 years ago I was able to resolve around 500 cyber-security vulnerabilities. The 
					resolution I found most interesting was using prepared statements in place of SQL queries to circumvent SQL injection 
					attempts by compiling the query before parameters are added and the query is executed.

							In fall of 2021 I did an individual course project in my graduate AI/ML class where I used chest radiographs to 
							predict various 
							lung observations. We used the CheXpert dataset, and had the option of either starting from raw images or using 
							extracted features provided by our professor from his work with the deepAUC team. I chose to use raw images because 
							I was interested in getting experience with convolutional neural networks, even if it required extra legwork.
						</p>
						<p>
							I used a DenseNet-121 architecture with hyperparameters selected by Bayesian optimization. Raw images were also 
							augmented by rotating positive or negative degrees, translating left and right, or scaling up and down. 
							There were a large number of uncertain labels in the data, so another major aspect of my project was handling 
							uncertain data in different ways.
						</p>
						<p>
							This course project was highly successful. Being the only student starting from raw images as far as I know, 
							an undergraduate student, and working on the project individually I was able to achieve the 3rd best AUC score on 
							the test dataset. My model had an AUC of 0.88, only behind models achieving 0.89. Additionally, on a personal level 
							it was a great way to gain experience with convolutional neural networks.

							Spring of 2022 I took a course on embedded systems. For our course project my partner and I developed a rotating 
							platform for firing a nerf dart remotely. All code was written in C and run on two Arduinos. The first Arduino 
							received input from the joystick using analog to digital conversion and then generated commands to transmit from 
							the master HC-06 Bluetooth transiever using USART communication. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The second Arduino received the commands, parsed them, and then controlled all of the functionality for the platform. 
							We used a stepper motor for the rotation of the platform, allowing for adjustable speed and full rotation. 
							When the joystick was pressed the the Arduino started a PWM signal to the servo motor, causing it to start rotating. 
							The motor was connected to the blaster trigger by fishing line which would pull back far enough to fire 
							when fully extended. The platform was built from scrap wood I had from other woodworking projects, and the stepper 
							motor had a 3d printed mount connecting it to the platform. All non-wood components were held to the platform with 
							zip ties.
